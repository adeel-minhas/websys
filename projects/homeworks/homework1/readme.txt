Web Systems Development

The doctype I selected was HTML5. I chose this doctype since it's the latest one and it's good to stay up to date. The implementation of the doctype is extremely easy
as compared to HTML4 or XML (and validation is a breeze)

Content in my resume is separated into different sections, with a header for my name and under that a photo of myself. Also, I put my contact information under my photo as well. I then listed my objective,
education, experience and then finally my skills. I used an <h1> tag for my name (since it should be the biggest thing in your resume). I used <h2> tags for objective, education, experience and skills.
I used <div> tags to separate each section as well (for styling purposes mainly). I used <ul> to list out my duties for each position that I held. I used a special <ul> id for my contact information.

For automated agents such as search engines robots, microformats can be easily found, because all it needs to do is find a specific markup (that may sound like something they might know) (for example, with hCard formatting, street address is given by street-address).
For humans, the hCard information is useful, because certain browsers will detect that there is hCard markup and allow the user to download the entire contact information as opposed to manually copy and pasting individual elements of the contact information.
Basically humans, would be able to quickly find information quickly based on the class names (p-street-address, etc.) and so could robots.

-Challenge Web Fonts/CSS3

I only changed the font (font-family: 'Dosis', sans-serif;) and made sure my name would pop out if you put your mouse over it.
